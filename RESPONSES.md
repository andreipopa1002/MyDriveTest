Response:
I've spent about two days to complete this task. The algorithm that is doing the conversions is not optimal, and will not find the best conversion rate, in order to achieve that it will need to be improved.

I've decided to use AFNetworking to interact with the web api because it is the most heavily tested third party framework and makes working with REST APIs easier.
For the conversion algorithm I've decided to go for a in depth recursive approach that will go towards the end of the possible path and see if it is a valid.
